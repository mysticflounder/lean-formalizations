# Small combinatorial counting results -- comparator challenge module (mathlib-only)

This file imports **mathlib only** and states this group's headline results as
`sorry` stubs. A reviewer reads THIS file (not the repository) to see exactly what
is claimed, in formal language, with no need to trust any project definition --
every type and predicate below is from mathlib.

`Solution.lean` in this directory imports the project and discharges each stub
with the real, axiom-clean project theorem, restating the **identical** signature
under the same `Headline.` name. The leanprover/comparator run checks that the two
modules' statements are identical and that the proofs are axiom-clean, so
statement drift between the two files cannot pass silently.

## Contents

Two independent counting results that share no source and no machinery, kept
together because neither carries a cluster of its own:

* no-three-collinear implies `ThreeAPFree`;
* the unit-distance elimination-order counting bound (`unitPairIndexFinset` and
  its companions inlined to their mathlib bodies).

## Scope

This is one of nine per-formalization comparator configurations; each is a
self-contained gate over its own results, so it can be registered and reviewed on
its own. `comparator/README.md` lists all nine and records the audit boundary --
which project results are gated here and which are audited by reading the repo.

Every theorem in this group's `Solution.lean` is axiom-clean: its `#print axioms`
closure is a subset of {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} -- no `sorryAx`,
no custom axioms, no `native_decide`. See `config.json` `permitted_axioms`.

open scoped Matrix Pointwise

-- The claims live in the shared namespace `Headline`, used identically in this
-- group's Challenge.lean and Solution.lean. The comparator (leanprover/comparator)
-- looks up each `config.json` theorem name in BOTH exports under the same
-- fully-qualified name, so the namespace must match across the two modules. It
-- also keeps the restatements from colliding with the project's own top-level
-- theorem names.
