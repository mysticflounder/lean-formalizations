# 2D two-point isometry classification -- comparator solution module

This file discharges every `sorry` stub in this directory's `Challenge.lean` by
importing the full project (`import LeanFormalizations`) and inhabiting each
headline statement with the real, axiom-clean project theorem.

Each theorem here states the **exact same signature** as its namesake in
`Challenge.lean` -- same `Headline.` name, identical statement -- and proves it
from the corresponding project declaration. The comparator
(<https://github.com/leanprover/comparator>) re-exports this closure and re-checks
it under both the `nanoda` kernel and the Lean default kernel.

## Contents

The two-point isometry classification in the plane: at most two isometries of
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)` agree on a fixed pair of distinct pinned points, and
the set of such isometries is finite. Both are stated over mathlib's
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) ≃ᵢ EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)`.

## Scope

See `config.json` in this directory for the `theorem_names` list and the permitted
axiom set, and `comparator/README.md` for the audit boundary across all nine
per-formalization configurations.

-- The claims live in the shared namespace `Headline`, used identically in this
-- group's Challenge.lean and Solution.lean. The comparator (leanprover/comparator)
-- looks up each `config.json` theorem name in BOTH exports under the same
-- fully-qualified name, so the namespace must match across the two modules. It
-- also keeps the restatements from colliding with the project's own top-level
-- theorem names.
